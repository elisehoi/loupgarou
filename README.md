To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` and `mix deps.get` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


## How to access the website from a remote machine
